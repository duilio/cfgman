## Reference

### docs-build

Build the documentation site.


### docs-deploy

Deploy the documentation site.


### docs-serve

Start the local server for the doc site.


### generate_readme

Generate the `README.md` for the `scripts/` folder.

Collect docstrings from each executable and generate a summary with a list of
each command with a short description and a reference with a longer
description.

The script format is identified by the hashbang, it currently supports only
the followings:

* python: `#!/usr/bin/env python`
* shell: `#!/bin/bash` and  `#!/bin/sh`

For shell scripts the docstring is the first block of comment excluding the
hashbang.
Python
[inspect.cleandoc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.cleandoc)
function is used for normalization.

#### Usage

Generate `scripts/README.md`:

    ./scripts/generate_readme

Check if there are no changes in the `README.md`:

    ./scripts/generate_readme -c

#### Template format

`README.md.template` is used as a template. The file is read and the expression
inside double-brackets (such as `{{ summary }}`) are replaced with generated
text.

A command may have an optional json dictionary for parameters.

##### Command list

- `summary` (no parameters): list of commands with their summary.
- `reference` (level: int = 0): one paragraph per command with a detailed
  description. You can change the starting heading level with the optional
  param `level`. (E.g. `{{ reference {"level": 2} }}`)

#### Docstring notes

- First paragraph is used for the summary.
- Summary must end with a punctuation character.
- Use Markdown for formatting.


### lint

Lint all files in the repo.

Just run pre-commit hooks and mypy on all files.


### test

Run all tests.
